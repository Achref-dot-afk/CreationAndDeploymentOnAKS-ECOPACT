## Introduction

The Water Monitoring Solution leverages modern cloud technologies to provide a comprehensive system for monitoring various parameters of water quality, such as pH, turbidity, temperature, and chemical composition. This system supports real-time data collection, analysis, and visualization, facilitating informed decision-making for water management.

## Architecture

The system architecture is designed for deployment on Azure Kubernetes Services, enabling automatic scaling and high availability.

## Implementation

### Development Environment

- The services are developed using Mern Stack.
- Each service is containerized using Docker.

### Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

- The solution is deployed on Azure Kubernetes Services, allowing for easy management and scaling based on demand.

### ArgoCD for Continuous Deployment

- ArgoCD manages the continuous deployment of the services to AKS, ensuring that the deployed state matches the desired state defined in Git repositories.

### Azure DevOps for CI/CD

- Azure DevOps pipelines are set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, streamlining the workflow for code integration and delivery.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- The CI/CD pipelines trigger on code commits, automatically building Docker images, running tests, and deploying updates to the AKS environment using ArgoCD.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics are employed to monitor the performance and health of the services. Logs and metrics are collected for analysis and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

- Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
- Docker
- ArgoCD
- Azure DevOps
